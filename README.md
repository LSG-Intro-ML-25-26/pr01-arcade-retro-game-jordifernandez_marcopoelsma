Lore:
A renowned architect is forced by his company to adopt a new, supposedly revolutionary architectural design software called MakeDesigns Arcade. At first, he’s genuinely excited: the interface is flashy, the tools promise faster workflows, and his creations seem to take shape with unsettling ease. For hours, he designs corridors, rooms, and impossible structures, convinced he’s witnessing the future of architecture.

But when he reviews his work, something feels wrong. Several rooms are gone. There are no error messages, no warnings, no backup files. They’ve simply… vanished. Confused, the architect tries to rebuild them, yet every time he saves the project, other sections of the building distort or disappear. He starts to question his own memory, checking old sketches and printed blueprints, only to confirm his growing fear: those rooms did exist.

As days pass, the glitches become more frequent—and more hostile. The designs seem to rearrange themselves, as if the software has a will of its own. Hallways leading nowhere. Doors that seal themselves shut. Spaces that defy all architectural logic. The studio fills with sleepless nights, cold coffee, and the constant hum of the laptop, as though something is always running in the background.

Driven to desperation, convinced the program is an unnatural abomination, the architect curses the developers who created it, swearing that no one should ever use such software again. In a final act of despair, broken by exhaustion, guilt, and the feeling of being consumed by his own creation, he takes his own life.

That’s when our crypto-bro programmer and tech speculator enters the scene, always hunting for high-value hardware and rare data. Hearing about the incident, she arrives with a single goal: to acquire the architect’s highly coveted RAM module, rumored to contain unique and invaluable information. But she soon discovers that the architect’s spirit still lingers, bound to both the laptop and the corrupted blueprints he created in life.

The architect’s soul now guards the RAM, manifesting as a ghost shaped by obsession, frustration, and unfinished work. To retrieve it, the player must uncover where the spirit is hiding, determine what type of ghost it is, and perform the appropriate ritual to banish or pacify it. Only then can the prized RAM be claimed… and the true nature of MakeDesigns Arcade begin to reveal itself.
